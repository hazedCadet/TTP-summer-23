This is the repository for the WebDev Bootcamp
=======
## Javascript 2 Workshop

### Getting Started:

1. Install the VSCode [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) Extensions (if they aren't already installed).

2. **Fork the repository to your personal GitHub Account**

3. `git clone` the forked repository and `cd` (change directories) so you are in the `ttp-2023-javascript2` directory in your terminal.

4. Once you've changed directories into the repository folder, execute the command `npm install` in your terminal. This installs the necessary packages for the test specs to run.

5. In the terminal, run the comman `npm test`. Once initiated, head to `http//localhost:8888`. This is where the list of test specs will be located.

Note: the npm commands **need to be executed inside of the ttp-2023-javascript2 directory**.

6. Review each problem carefully. Instructions for each are in the `${num}_instructions.md`. To run the markdown preview, use `CMD + SHIFT + V` on Mac, or `CTRL + SHIFT + V` on Windows.

7. Write your solution code in the `${num}_solution.js` file.

8. Run the test specs to test your code.

### Submission

Once you've passed all test specs, **commit your changes and push them to your repository on GitHub to be graded by your instructional team**.

Once again, please make sure to **PUSH** all of your work to Github, you can verify that your code is on your repository by visiting your Github Account and checking the repository.

**Example**

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'completed exercises'
$ git push origin main
```

Good luck!
